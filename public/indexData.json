(Use #news or Listings.)\nContributor requests. (Use #contributorswanted or Listings.)\nTutorials/articles that happen to use an open source tool. (Use appropriate technology tags.)\nShowing off something you've built that happens to be open source. (Use the #showdev tag.)\nSharing lists of open source projects. (Use #githunt or the appropriate technology tags.)\n\n\nProjects must comply with the Open Source Definition (see below) to legally use the term \"open source\".\n\nAs all \"Free Software\" officially complies with the standards of Open Source anyway, this tag covers both (collectively, FOSS).\n\n            \n          \n          \n            \n              about #opensource\n            \n            \n              Open Source is so much more than \"you can read the code\".

Generally, all Free Software is also Open Source, and the two camps often cooperate; however, the concepts are distinct!
